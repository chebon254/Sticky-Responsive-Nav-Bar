            <p>Last week we were focusing on waiting and we invite you to listen to message attached in the link below here if you were not able to be with us in person this week. Or, if you were and wanted to catch something you missed you are welcome.
                Take a moment before you listen to ask for God's Holy Spirit to open your heart to hear this word.</p>
            <p>Take precautionary care during this period in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, follow advisory messages given by various health  agencies and government directives.</p>
            <p>At W3Schools you will find complete references about HTML elements, attributes, events, color names, entities, character-sets, URL encoding, language codes, HTTP messages, browser support, and more:</p>
            <p>Please share your autobiography with your facilitator and fellow students here. Also, consider this the student lounge, where you can relax and get to know one another in a less formal setting!  The assignment is a discussion assignment, and as a result, the successful completion is worth 30 points.</p>
            <p>Good organization of information (Data Structures) and logic flow (algorithms) ensures creating efficient programs. During this week you will review some of the basic Java Programming terminologies covered in CSC111-Programming I and latter be introduced to the fundamental concept of data structures and to emphasize the importance of data structures in developing and implementing efficient algorithms</p>
